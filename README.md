## R Project

Fecal IgA, antigen absorption, and gut microbiome composition contribute to food antigen sensitization in genetically-susceptible mice


## Folder Structure

The project comprises of 5 main folders the microbiome and machine learning analysis.

### Data/

Contains input data from microbiome count table and fecal IgA measurements 

### R script/

This folder contain R script files used in the analysis.

In this folder:

1. **preprocessData** - used to preprocess data including count tables
2. **preSenstitizationByStrain_Heatmaps** - script for the preSenstitization 
3. **compositionalPertubation_analysis** - script for pertubation analysis 
4. **comp_diversity** - script for diversity analysis

### Functions/
Contains helper functions for zero imputation, recursive feature selection, and procrustes analysis 

### Output/
Contains output data and tables from R script routines

### Figures/

This folder contains all main and supplemntal figures in manuscript
